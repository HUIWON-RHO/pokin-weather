- [x] Gradient color on react

## Expo vs React

**_Expo CLI_**

👍

        Easy to release

        Don't need Android/ X-code for running on the phone

        Easy install and configuration

👎

        Build file size is huge

        Javascript app only

        Unavailable add Java, Kotlin, object-C, Swift

**_React-Native CLI_**

👍

        Available to use custom native module (can add using any language)

        Can make module if needed

👎

        Release/ Update is not comfy

        Beginning configuration is not short

        MacOS -> iOS/Android👌 BUT❗ Windows -> Android👌

## Tips

- 20px❌, 20⭕, "20px"⭕

- **Axios** is a Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript which can be used in your front-end application and in your Node. (통신용 라이브러리)

        👍 Not heavy, has a way to abort request, has a way to set response timeout, works in Node.js

        👎 Using ES6 version JS

- **PropTypes**

        👍 Helpful to catch error (num, string etc)

           More readable

        ✔ After react 16, it's not contained. Need to install prop-types.
